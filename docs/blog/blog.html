      <h3>Holyoke Public Library bathrooms</h3>
      <p><i>12 July, 2023</i><br></p>
      <p>I've been meaning to practice writing my thoughts more frequently, and decided to start today, with the Holyoke Pulbic Library bathrooms. 
      Since April and until about two weeks ago, I had been working on an almost daily basis at the Holyoke Public Library. 
      One of the quirks is that the library bathrooms are highly restricted. 
      To access them you need to ask for a key, and they try to make sure you don't use it for very long. 
      The justification is to prevent drug users from "shooting up" in the restroom.
      The only restroom we were allowed was on the fourth floor, and you had to ask the librarian for the key. 
      Many times there was no librarian on the fourth floor, and once I was told it was too close to closing time (20 minutes until closing), 
       and I wasn't allowed to use it. That day I decided to switch libraries and now mostly work at the South Hadley Public library 
      (which is nicer in many ways).</p>
      <p>Today I returned to the Holyoke library, because it opens earlier and I had an early meeting. 
      There is now a security guard at the entrance (who does regular rounds), and he hands out the key to the bathroom after scanning your library card. 
      The justification is that there were many drug users using the bathrooms, 
       and they want to create a safe environment for families and children to come to. 
      These are understandable motivations, but I'm unconvinced that restricting access to the bathroom 
       is going to bring children and families to the library. 
      The park surrounding the library is still filled with people who seem to be drug users, 
       and that's probably because the library is in a poor and troubled neighborhood in one of the poorest towns in Massachusetts. 
      Using the bathroom is a human right, whether you use drugs or not. 
      And the struggle to attract children and families to the library is bigger than restricting bathroom access. 
      I don't have the solution, but perhaps some work <em>with</em> the community to come up with ways to make the area feel safe and welcoming. 
      Or perhaps some additional bathrooms, or a space for users near the park (there seem to be many vacant areas surrounding the library). 
      I don't know. But the restrictions on bathroom use have certainly made me feel unwelcome.</p>
