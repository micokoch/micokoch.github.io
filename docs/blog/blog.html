       <h2>Holyoke Public Library bathrooms</h2>
       <p><i>12 July, 2023</i><br></p>
       <p>I've been meaning to practice writing my thoughts more frequently, and decided to start today, 
       writing about the <a href = "https://www.holyokelibrary.org">Holyoke Pulbic Library</a> bathrooms. 
      Since April and until about two weeks ago, 
      I had been working on an almost daily basis at the Holyoke Public Library. 
      One of the quirks is that the library bathrooms are somewhat restricted. 
      To access them you need to ask for a key, and they try to make sure you don't use it for very long. 
      The justification is to prevent drug users from "shooting up" in the restroom.
      The only restroom I was allowed was on the fourth floor, and I had to ask the librarian for the key. 
      Many times there was no librarian on the fourth floor, 
      and once I was told by her that it was too close to closing time (20 minutes until closing), 
       and I wasn't allowed to use it. That day I decided to switch libraries and now mostly work at the 
       <a href="https://www.shadleylib.org/">South 
        Hadley Public library</a> (which is nicer in many ways).</p>
      <p>Today I returned to the Holyoke library, because it opens earlier and I had an early meeting. 
      There is now a security guard at the entrance (who does regular rounds around the library), 
       and if you need the restroom, he hands out the key after scanning your library card 
       (he was very friendly about it all). 
      As it was explained to me, the reason is that there were many drug users using the bathrooms, 
       and they want to create a safe environment in the library for families and children to come to. 
      The motivations are understandable, but I'm unconvinced that restricting access to the bathroom 
       is going to bring children and families to the library. 
      The park surrounding the library has plenty of people who seem to be drug users, 
       and that's probably because the library is in a poor and troubled neighborhood 
       in one of the poorest towns in Massachusetts. 
      I understand how this can scare off families, 
      but I also believe that using the bathroom is a human right, whether you use drugs or not. 
      And the struggle to attract children and families to the library 
      is not solved by restricting bathroom access. 
      I don't have the solution, 
      but perhaps some work could be done <em>with</em> the community (including users) 
       to come up with ways to make the area feel safe and welcoming. 
      Or perhaps some additional bathrooms could be built, or a space for users near the park 
      (there seem to be many vacant areas surrounding the library). 
      I don't know. 
      But the restrictions on bathroom use 
      have certainly made <i>me</i> feel unwelcome at the Holyoke library.</p>
