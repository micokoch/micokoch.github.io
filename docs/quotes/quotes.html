       <h1>Thoughts and words of others</h1>
      
       <p>"Free your mind of the idea of deserving, of the idea of earning, and you will begin to be able to think."
        <br> - Ursula K. Le Guin, "The Dispossessed" (1974)</br></p>
      
       <p>"Modern industrial civilization has developed within a certain system of convenient myths. 
        The driving force of modern industrial civilization has been individual material gain -- 
        Now it's long been understood; very well; that a society that is based on this principle will destroy itself in time. 
        It can only persist; with whatever suffering and injustice it entails; 
        as long as it's possible to pretend that the destructive forces that humans create are limited, 
        that the world is an infinite resource, and that the world is an infinite garbage can. 
        At this stage of history either -- the general population will take control of its own destiny 
        and will concern itself with community issues guided by values of solidarity, and sympathy, and concern for others, or; 
        alternatively; there will be no destiny for anyone to control." 
         <br> - Noam Chomsky, in the film "Manufacturing Consent" (1992)</br></p>
      
       <p>"You've lived too long in New York, I told her. There are other worlds. Other kinds of dreams. 
        Dreams in which failure is feasible, honorable, sometimes even worth striving for. 
        Worlds in which recognition is not the only barometer of brilliance or human worth. 
        There are plenty of warriors I know and love, people far more valuable than myself, who go to war each day, 
        knowing in advance that they will fail. 
        True, they are less "successful" in the most vulgar sense of the word, but by no means less fulfilled. 
        The only dream worth having, I told her, is to dream that you will live while you're alive and die only when you're dead. 
        (Prescience? Perhaps.)
        "Which means exactly what?" (Arched eyebrows, a little annoyed.)
        I tried to explain, but didn't do a very good job of it. Sometimes I need to write to think. 
        So I wrote it down for her on a paper napkin. This is what I wrote: 
        To love. To be loved. To never forget your own insignificance. 
        To never get used to the unspeakable violence and the vulgar disparity of life around you. 
        To seek joy in the saddest places. To pursue beauty to its lair. 
        To never simplify what is complicated or complicate what is simple. 
        To respect strength, never power. 
        Above all, to watch. To try and understand. To never look away. 
        And never, never to forget."
         <br> - Arundhati Roy, "The End of Imagination" (1998)</br></p>
        
        <p>"Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: 
         the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind."
         <br> - Bertrand Russell in the prologue to his autobiography (1956)</br></p>
      
       <p>"Au milieu de l’hiver, j’apprenais enfin qu’il y avait en moi un été invincible."
        <br> - Albert Camus, "Retour à Tipasa" - "L'été" (1953)</br></p>
      
       <p>"La main qui donne est la main qui dirige."
        <br> - Proverbe Bantou cité par Patrice Lumumba dans le film du même nom (2000)</br></p>
        
       <p>"I felt so lucky and privileged not to be out there in the muddy field - 
        to be making music every night for an attentive audience. 
        But the shock of what was going on made it hard to separate what we were doing 
        from the horrible and persistent abuse of money and power and that is at the root of these situations. 
        Profit dictates our decisions on a global scale. Most of us know this should not be happening. 
        And yet the debates we are offered are <em>where</em> we should store our nuclear waste, 
        <em>when</em> we should stop heating the earth's atmosphere, 
        <em>what</em> kind_ of missiles we would like to have pointed at us from space, and 
        <em>who</em> should benefit from lengthy incarceration and even death at the hands of the state. 
        Rampant poverty and boundless riches co-exist as the norm. 
        How do you protest a system that co-opts and marginalizes almost every unique and original thought that confronts it? 
        And how do you stay silent?"
         <br> - Dave Douglas in the liner notes for his album "Witness" (2001), 
        commenting on US arms sales during the Clinton administration</br></p>
      
       <p>"There is no question in my mind that the intellectual belongs on the same side with the weak and unrepresented 
        - Robin Hood, some are likely to say. 
        Yet it’s not that simple a role, and therefore cannot be easily dismissed as just so much romantic idealism. 
        At bottom, the intellectual in my sense of the word is neither a pacifier nor a consensus-builder, 
        but someone whose whole being is staked on a critical sense, a sense of being unwilling to accept easy formulas, 
        or ready-made cliches, or the smooth, ever-so-accommodating confirmations of what the powerful or conventional have to say, 
        and what they do. 
        Not just passively unwilling, but actively willing to say so in public. 
        This is not always a matter of being a critic of government policy, 
        but rather of thinking of the intellectual vocation as maintaining a state of constant alertness, 
        of a perpetual willingness not to let half-truths or received ideas steer one along. 
        This involves a steady realism and almost athletic rational energy; 
        and a complicated struggle to balance the problem of one’s own selfhood against the demands of publishing 
        and speaking out in the public sphere is what makes it an everlasting effort 
        - constitutively unfinished and necessarily imperfect. 
        Yet its invigorations and complexities are, for me at least, the richer for it, 
        even though it doesn’t make one particularly popular."
        <br>- Edward Said, The Reith Lectures (1993)</br></p>
        
       <p>"Make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit the walls of the ego recede, 
        and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life."
        <br> - Bertrand Russell, "How to grow old" (1953)</br></p>
        
       <p>"We've known for a long time that it was no longer possible to overturn this world, nor reshape it, 
        nor head off its dangerous headlong rush. 
        There's been only one possible resistance: to not take it seriously."
        <br>Milan Kundera, "The Festival of Insignificance (2013)" </p>
      
       <p>"In the age of globalization, your dignity is determined by your passport. 
        If you're American or European, you will get your Emirati visa in the VIP section, and other nationalities will wait on you. 
        In other countries, borders will fall magically at your advent, and visas will be provided on arrival at the airport. 
        Ir you're Indian or Filipino, you will wait endlessly in line and be treated with casual rudeness, 
        along with all the other Unimportant Persons.
        In the twenty-first century, your humanity is defined by your nationality. 
        And those who have no nationality  - the Palestinians, the Rohingya - are fucked. 
        They will wander the earth, powerless."
        <br> - Suketu Mehta, "This Land Is Our Land: An Immigrant's Manifesto" (2019)</br></p>
      
       <p>"The story of the origins of capitalism, then, is not the story of the gradual destruction of traditional communities 
        by the impersonal power of the market. 
        It is, rather, the story of how an economy of credit was converted into an economy of interest; 
        of the gradual transformation of moral networks by the intrusion of the impersonal - and often vindictive - 
        power of the state."
        <br> - David Graeber, "Debt: the first 5,000 years" (2011)</br></p>

       <p>"Capitalism is a system that enshrines the gambler as an essential part of its operation, in a way that no other ever has; 
        yet at the same time, capitalism seems to be uniquely incapable of conceiving of its own eternity."
        <br> - David Graeber, "Debt: the first 5,000 years" (2011)</br></p>
      
       <p>"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here!"
        <br> - Dumbledore in J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"</br></p>
