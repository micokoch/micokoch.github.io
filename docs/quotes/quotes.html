          <p>Modern industrial civilization has developed within a certain system of convenient myths. 
           The driving force of modern industrial civilization has been individual material gain, 
           which is accepted as legitimate, even praiseworthy, 
           on the grounds that private vices yield public benefits in the classic formulation.</p><br><br>
          <p>Now, it's long been understood, very well, that a society that is based on this principle will destroy itself in time. 
           It can only persist, with whatever suffering and injustice it entails, 
           as long as it's possible to pretend that the destructive forces that humans create are limited, 
           that the world is an infinite resource, and that the world is an infinite garbage can. 
           At this stage of history, either one of two things is possible: 
           either the general population will take control of its own destiny and will concern itself with community interests, 
           guided by values of solidarity and sympathy and concern for others, 
           or, alternatively, there will be no destiny for anyone to control.</p><br><br>
          <p>As long as some specialized class is in a position of authority, it is going to set policy in the special interests that it serves. 
           But the conditions of survival, let alone justice, require rational social planning in the interests of the community as a whole, 
           and, by now, that means the global community. 
           The question is whether privileged elites should dominate mass communication, and should use this power as they tell us they must, 
           namely, to impose necessary illusions, to manipulate and deceive the stupid majority, and remove them from the public arena. 
           The question, in brief, is whether democracy and freedom are values to be preserved or threats to be avoided. 
           In this possibly terminal phase of human existence, democracy and freedom are more than values to be treasured, 
           they may well be essential to survival.</p>

          <p>You've lived too long in New York, I told her. There are other worlds. Other kinds of dreams. 
           Dreams in which failure is feasible, honorable, sometimes even worth striving for. 
           Worlds in which recognition is not the only barometer of brilliance or human worth. 
           There are plenty of warriors I know and love, people far more valuable than myself, who go to war each day, 
           knowing in advance that they will fail. 
           True, they are less "successful" in the most vulgar sense of the word, but by no means less fulfilled.</p><br><br>
          <p>The only dream worth having, I told her, is to dream that you will live while you're alive and die only when you're dead. 
           (Prescience? Perhaps.)</p><br><br>
          <p>"Which means exactly what?" (Arched eyebrows, a little annoyed.)</p><br><br>
          <p>I tried to explain, but didn't do a very good job of it. Sometimes I need to write to think. 
           So I wrote it down for her on a paper napkin. This is what I wrote:</p><br><br>
          <p>To love. To be loved. To never forget your own insignificance. 
           To never get used to the unspeakable violence and the vulgar disparity of life around you. 
           To seek joy in the saddest places. To pursue beauty to its lair. 
           To never simplify what is complicated or complicate what is simple. 
           To respect strength, never power. 
           Above all, to watch. To try and understand. To never look away. 
           And never, never to forget.</p>

          <p>I felt so lucky and privileged not to be out there in the muddy field - 
           to be making music every night for an attentive audience. 
           But the shock of what was going on made it hard to separate what we were doing 
           from the horrible and persistent abuse of money and power and that is at the root of these situations. 
           Profit dictates our decisions on a global scale. Most of us know this should not be happening. 
           And yet the debates we are offered are <em>where</em> we should store our nuclear waste, 
           <em>when</em> we should stop heating the earth's atmosphere, 
           <em>what kind</em> of missiles we would like to have pointed at us from space, and 
           <em>who</em> should benefit from lengthy incarceration and even death at the hands of the state. 
           Rampant poverty and boundless riches co-exist as the norm. 
           How do you protest a system that co-opts and marginalizes almost every unique and original thought that confronts it? 
           And how do you stay silent?</p>

          <p>There is no question in my mind that the intellectual belongs on the same side with the weak and unrepresented 
           - Robin Hood, some are likely to say. 
           Yet it’s not that simple a role, and therefore cannot be easily dismissed as just so much romantic idealism. 
           At bottom, the intellectual in my sense of the word is neither a pacifier nor a consensus-builder, 
           but someone whose whole being is staked on a critical sense, a sense of being unwilling to accept easy formulas, 
           or ready-made cliches, or the smooth, ever-so-accommodating confirmations of what the powerful or conventional have to say, 
           and what they do. 
           Not just passively unwilling, but actively willing to say so in public. 
           This is not always a matter of being a critic of government policy, 
           but rather of thinking of the intellectual vocation as maintaining a state of constant alertness, 
           of a perpetual willingness not to let half-truths or received ideas steer one along. 
           This involves a steady realism and almost athletic rational energy; 
           and a complicated struggle to balance the problem of one’s own selfhood against the demands of publishing 
           and speaking out in the public sphere is what makes it an everlasting effort 
           - constitutively unfinished and necessarily imperfect. 
           Yet its invigorations and complexities are, for me at least, the richer for it, 
           even though it doesn’t make one particularly popular.</p>

           Insofar as the time they are taking off from work is being spent with friends and family, 
           enjoying and caring for those they love, they're probably improving the world more than we acknowledge.

           It seems to me that we are long overdue for some kind of Biblical-style Jubilee: 
           one that would affect both international debt and consumer debt. 
           It would be salutary not just because it would relieve so much genuine human suffering, 
           but also because it would be our way of reminding ourselves that money is not ineffable, 
           that paying one's debts is not the essence of morality, 
           that all these things are human arrangements and that if democracy is to mean anything, 
           it is the ability to all agree to arrange things in a different way.</p>

           If freedom (real freedom) is the ability to make friends,

           What sort of promises might genuinely free men and women make to one another?
           At this point, we can't even say. 
           It's more a question of how we can get to a place that will allow us to find out. 
           And the first step in that journey, in turn, is to accept that in the largest scheme of things, 
           just as no one has the right to tell us our true value, 
           no one has the right to tell us what we truly owe.</p>
