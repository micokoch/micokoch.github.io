       <h1>Thoughts and words of others</h1>
       <p>"Modern industrial civilization has developed within a certain system of convenient myths. 
        The driving force of modern industrial civilization has been individual material gain -- 
        Now it's long been understood; very well; that a society that is based on this principle will destroy itself in time. 
        It can only persist; with whatever suffering and injustice it entails; 
        as long as it's possible to pretend that the destructive forces that humans create are limited, 
        that the world is an infinite resource, and that the world is an infinite garbage can. 
        At this stage of history either -- the general population will take control of its own destiny 
        and will concern itself with community issues guided by values of solidarity, and sympathy, and concern for others, or; 
        alternatively; there will be no destiny for anyone to control." 
         <br> - Noam Chomsky, in the film "Manufacturing Consent"</br></p>
       <p>"You've lived too long in New York, I told her. There are other worlds. Other kinds of dreams. 
        Dreams in which failure is feasible, honorable, sometimes even worth striving for. 
        Worlds in which recognition is not the only barometer of brilliance or human worth. 
        There are plenty of warriors I know and love, people far more valuable than myself, who go to war each day, 
        knowing in advance that they will fail. 
        True, they are less "successful" in the most vulgar sense of the word, but by no means less fulfilled. 
        The only dream worth having, I told her, is to dream that you will live while you're alive and die only when you're dead. 
        (Prescience? Perhaps.)
        "Which means exactly what?" (Arched eyebrows, a little annoyed.)
        I tried to explain, but didn't do a very good job of it. Sometimes I need to write to think. 
        So I wrote it down for her on a paper napkin. This is what I wrote: 
        To love. To be loved. To never forget your own insignificance. 
        To never get used to the unspeakable violence and the vulgar disparity of life around you. 
        To seek joy in the saddest places. To pursue beauty to its lair. 
        To never simplify what is complicated or complicate what is simple. 
        To respect strength, never power. 
        Above all, to watch. To try and understand. To never look away. 
        And never, never to forget."
         <br> - Arundhati Roy, "The End of Imagination"</br></p>
        <p>"Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: 
         the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind."
         <br> - Bertrand Russell in the prologue to his autobiography, 1956</br></p>
       <p>"La main qui donne est la main qui dirige."
        <br> - Proverbe Bantou cité par Patrice Lumumba dans le film du même nom</br></p>
